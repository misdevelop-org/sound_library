```

##### Play a sound from the `Sounds` library

```dart
  SoundPlayer.play(Sounds.click);
```
  
##### Play a sound from a `URL` path
  
```dart  
  SoundPlayer.playFromUrl(path);
```

##### Play a sound from a `file` path

```dart
  SoundPlayer.playFromDeviceFilePath(file);
```

##### Play a sound from an `asset` path

```dart
  SoundPlayer.playFromAssetPath(asset);
```

##### Play a sound from `bytes`

```dart
  SoundPlayer.playFromBytes(bytes);
```

##### Check if audio is currently `enabled`
  
```dart  
  bool enabled = SoundPlayer.isAudioEnabled;
```

##### Check if audio is `enabled` on the device storage
This will also load the state from the device storage onto the `isAudioEnabled` property

```dart
  bool enabled = await SoundPlayer.checkLocalStorageEnabled();
```

##### Enable/disable sounds
This will also save the state to the device storage
  
```dart  
  SoundPlayer.setAudioEnabled(true/false);
```
